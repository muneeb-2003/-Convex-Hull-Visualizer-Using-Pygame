# Convex-Hull-Visualizer-Using-Pygame
A fully interactive and educational Python application to visualize the **Convex Hull** problem using the **Pygame** library. The tool lets you dynamically add points on a 2D plane and watch in real-time as a convex hull is constructed around them using computational geometry algorithms.
## 📖 About the Project

This project aims to help students and developers understand how convex hull algorithms work by providing a **graphical and interactive simulation**. Instead of dealing with abstract math and code alone, this tool allows users to see how the convex hull is formed around a set of random or user-defined points.

It is a great educational tool for:
- Learning computational geometry
- Demonstrating algorithms like **Graham's Scan** or **Jarvis March**
- Enhancing your understanding of **2D geometry** and **game development basics** using Pygame

## ❓ What is a Convex Hull?

> The **Convex Hull** of a set of points is the smallest convex polygon that completely encloses all the points.

Imagine placing nails into a board in random positions and stretching a rubber band around them. When you release the rubber band, it will snap tightly around the outermost nails — that’s essentially the convex hull.

In 2D, it can be visualized as:
- The polygon with the smallest perimeter enclosing all given points
- A building block for more complex geometric algorithms
